It’s often said that we all have a lof of problems, until we get sick - then we have only one.

Your body is the most important system you will ever maintain. Every goal you chase, every relationship you value, and every success you work toward depends on it. Without health, everything else fades into the background.

The regret of not taking care of yourself sooner, hurts far more than the discomfort of discipline - waking up early, sleeping on time, eating clean, and lifting the weights.
